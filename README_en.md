## Introduction
Kawaii Physics is a pseudo-physics plugin for Unreal Engine 4 and 5. It allows you to create simple and cute animations for objects like hair, skirts, and breasts.

Character used: Gray-chan [Gray-chan](http://rarihoma.xvs.jp/products/graychan)

## Features
![Kawaii Physics 2](https://github.com/pafuhana1213/Screenshot/blob/master/KawaiiPhysics2.jpg)  
![Kawaii Physics 4](https://github.com/pafuhana1213/Screenshot/blob/master/KawaiiPhysics4.gif)  
- Respects the original shape while controlling physics based on the animation and movement/rotation of the SkeletalMeshComponent.
- Use the "KawaiiPhysics Node" included in the plugin in the AnimGraph of AnimationBP.
- You can make specified bones and their child bones move according to the character's motion.
- With only two types of physics control parameters, it is easier to set up compared to the engine's standard [AnimDynamics](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Animation/NodeReference/SkeletalControls/AnimDynamics/index.html).
- You can add sphere, capsule, and plane collisions.
- Adjust the position, orientation, and size of each collision in the animation editor's viewport.
- Maintains bone length, preventing bones from stretching or shrinking even if calculations fail.
- Uses a simple algorithm without PhysX, which should result in lower overhead compared to the engine's standard physics system.

## Reference Material for Implementing Physics Behavior
[Next Generation Idolmaster Graphics & Animation Programming Preview](https://cedil.cesa.or.jp/cedil_sessions/view/416)

## Operating Environment
- UE5.3 ~ 5.5  
[KawaiiPhysics Releases](https://github.com/pafuhana1213/KawaiiPhysics/releases/)
- UE4.27  
[KawaiiPhysics Release for UE4.27](https://github.com/pafuhana1213/KawaiiPhysics/releases/tag/20230830-v1.11.1)
- UE4.26 and earlier (Plugin only)  
[KawaiiPhysics Release for UE4.26 and earlier](https://github.com/pafuhana1213/KawaiiPhysics/releases/tag/20201202-v1.7.0)

When building for UE4.26 and earlier, you need to modify GetSkeleton() to Skeleton.

When building for UE4.21 and earlier, you need to modify GEngine->ConstraintLimitMaterialPrismatic->GetRenderProxy() to GEngine->ConstraintLimitMaterialPrismatic->GetRenderProxy(false) in KawaiiPhysicsEditMode.cpp.

When building for UE4.23 and earlier, you need to modify "Type": "UncookedOnly" to "Type": "DeveloperTool" in KawaiiPhysics.uplugin (probably).

## How to Use
- Place the KawaiiPhysics folder in your project's Plugins folder.
- About each parameter: [Parameter Details]([https://github.com/pafuhana1213/KawaiiPhysics/wiki/%E5%90%84%E3%83%91%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6](https://github.com/pafuhana1213/KawaiiPhysics/wiki/%E5%90%84%E3%83%91%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6--About-each-parameters))

- For BP projects, errors occur during packaging. Please either convert to a C++ project or try the method introduced in the following article.  
[How to Package UE5 KawaiiPhysics for Blueprint Projects - PaperSloth’s Diary](https://papersloth.hatenablog.com/entry/2024/02/14/201629)

### Converting BP Projects to C++ Projects
You can convert to a C++ project by adding C++ code from the "C++ Class Wizard".  
[C++ Class Wizard Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/using-the-cplusplus-class-wizard-in-unreal-engine/)

However, you need to prepare an environment that can build C++, such as Visual Studio.
